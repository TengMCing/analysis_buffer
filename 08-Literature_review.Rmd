Mention that the underlying grammar of `ggplot2` is particularly useful in graphical inference.

Mention that model metrics such as AIC are commonly used in model assessment. However, visual inspection can be a powerful model diagnostics and it often works better than formal tests in meta-analysis. The author of this paper also writes an R package `simfit` to visually check whether too many or too few zeros are produced by the assumed GLM, relative to the original data.  

### Visualization in Bayesian Workflow

@article{gabry2019visualization,
  title={Visualization in Bayesian workflow},
  author={Gabry, Jonah and Simpson, Daniel and Vehtari, Aki and Betancourt, Michael and Gelman, Andrew},
  journal={Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A: Statistics in Society},
  volume={182},
  number={2},
  pages={389--402},

}
```

This paper promotes the use of visualization tools in Bayesian workflow. It quotes a sentence from @buja2009statistical to emphasize the importance of visualization in quantitative statistical procedures.

### Peeking Inside the Black Box: Visualizing Statistical Learning With Plots of Individual Conditional Expectation

@article{goldstein2015peeking,
  title={Peeking inside the black box: Visualizing statistical learning with plots of individual conditional expectation},
  author={Goldstein, Alex and Kapelner, Adam and Bleich, Justin and Pitkin, Emil},
  journal={journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics},
  volume={24},
  number={1},
  pages={44--65},
  year={2015},
  publisher={Taylor \& Francis}
}
```

This paper proposes a new type of plot called individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot which can better visualize any supervised learning model than the classical partial dependence plots (PDPs). It mentions that @buja2009statistical addresses the problem of assessing the statistical validity of discoveries made by examining plots. This paper also adapts the visual inference framework and proposes a new testing procedure called additivity lineup test.  

## Why Authors Don't Visualize Uncertainty

@article{hullman2019authors,
  title={Why authors don't visualize uncertainty},
  author={Hullman, Jessica},
  journal={IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics},
  volume={26},
  number={1},
  pages={130--139},
  year={2019},
  publisher={IEEE}
}
```

This paper conducts a survey to understand why do so many visualization authors choose not to visualize uncertainty. It mentions several statisticians have proposed that the process by which a person visually examine a graph to evaluate the strength of evidence is analogous to a statistical test. While the primary goal of these analogies has been to define methods for generating visualizations to compare to observed data, accounts by @buja2009statistical also acknowledge the role visualizations play in informal statistical inference. In this process, a visualization is compared to an implicit reference distribution to determine whether the visualization presents something interesting. 



<!-- ## Dimensionality Reduction by Learning an Invariant Mapping -->

<!-- Dimensionality reduction involves mapping a set of high dimensional input points onto a low dimensional manifold so that "similar" points in input space are mapped to nearby points on the manifold. -->

<!-- - **Our lineup image can be considered as a high dimensional input point.** -->

<!-- - learning a globally coherent nonlinear function that maps the data evenly to the output manifold -->
<!-- - The learning relies solely on neighborhood relationships and does not require any distancemeasure in the input space.  -->
