# Plan

## Summary of the current progress

We have identified several potential methods for constructing the system. However, there are numerous crucial questions that currently remain unanswered. For instance, we are uncertain whether the system can effectively detect residual departures in a manner similar to humans. To address this, it is necessary to proceed with training the computer vision model and conduct experiments to test the hypothesis.

It is essential to emphasize the importance of accurate training and extensive testing to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the system. By subjecting the model to a wide range of scenarios and collecting comprehensive data, we can gain valuable insights into its capabilities and limitations.

Additionally, ongoing evaluation and refinement of the computer vision model will be necessary to address any potential shortcomings.

## Plan for the next step

To facilitate better organization and adherence to the project timeline, a detailed plan is outlined below:

### Define the Objectives

Clearly establish the goals and objectives of the system, including the specific requirements for detecting residual departures.

### Data Prepration

Prepare a diverse and representative dataset that encompasses various types of departures and their corresponding human observations.

### Model Training

Develop and implement a training pipeline that incorporates state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. Train the model using the collected dataset, ensuring a balance between performance and computational efficiency.

### Testing and Evaluation

Conduct rigorous testing by applying the trained model to a range of real-world scenarios and comparing its performance to human observations. Measure the accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to assess the model's effectiveness.

### Iterative refinement

Based on the evaluation results, identify areas where the model may fall short and refine the training process accordingly. Continuously iterate on the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training techniques to improve performance.
